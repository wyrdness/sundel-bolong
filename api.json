      "full": "The **sundel bolong** (also written as **sundal bolong** or **sondel bolong**) is one of Indonesia's most terrifying and distinctive female ghosts. Her name literally translates to \\\"hollow prostitute\\\" or \\\"prostitute with a hole,\\\" referring to her defining characteristic: a gaping hole or hollow cavity in her back, often described as extending through her torso. This horrifying feature sets her apart from other Indonesian female spirits and makes her immediately recognizable in Indonesian supernatural lore. Unlike the pontianak or kuntilanak, which are also female ghosts associated with pregnancy and childbirth, the sundel bolong has a distinctly different origin story and behavior pattern. She is typically the spirit of a woman who died during pregnancy or childbirth under tragic, shameful, or violent circumstances—often as an unmarried woman, a victim of sexual violence, or someone who died in disgrace. Her transformation into a sundel bolong reflects themes of shame, honor, vengeance, and the social consequences faced by women who transgressed or were victimized. The sundel bolong appears as a beautiful woman, often dressed in traditional Indonesian clothing or a white *kebaya*, with long black hair flowing down her back. Her beauty is deceptive—a lure to attract victims, particularly men. Only when she turns around or when someone sees her from behind does her true horror become apparent: the gaping hole in her back, sometimes described as revealing internal organs, sometimes as a void, and sometimes as crawling with maggots or insects. The sundel bolong embodies complex cultural anxieties about female sexuality, honor and shame, pregnancy outside marriage, and the treatment of women. She is both victim and monster, tragic figure and source of terror. Her legend serves as a cautionary tale while also expressing sympathy for women who died in tragic circumstances."
